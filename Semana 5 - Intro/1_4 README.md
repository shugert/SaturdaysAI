=====

- Understand the data using descriptive statistics and graphs

Topic overview
----

The goal of exploratory analysis is to summarize the main characteristics of a data set, with the belief that it may lead to new hypotheses that inform algorithm choice and experimentation. Exploratory analysis happens before formal modeling commences, and is extremely important for helping inform or sharpen your hypothesis.
